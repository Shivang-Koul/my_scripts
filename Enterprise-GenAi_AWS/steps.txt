1.	After Logging Into AWS Console, Go To Amazon SageMaker AI.

1a. In SageMaker AI, Go To Studio And Create A User With Default Settings.

1b. Launch Studio To Create JupyterLab Space With Default Settings. Example: (Instance: ml.t3.medium, Storage: 5GB).

1c. Open Jupyter Notebook, Import “jupyter_notebook.ipynb” File From Desktop.

1d. Run The Code Starting From Step 2 Until Step 3 At Least, Then Continue Running All Code Sections.

2a. Now, Go To AWS Lambda And Create A Function. While Configuring, Choose Python 3.11.

2b. Make Sure The IAM Role Has AmazonSageMakerFullAccess Policy Attached To API Gateway Or Your Organisation’s Policy.

2c. Copy The Code From Desktop “lambda_function.py” File And Paste It In The Lambda Code Editor.

2d. Go To Configurations → Environment Variables → Add Environment Variable.

2e. Key → ENDPOINT_NAME, Value → “hf-llm-falcon-7b-instruct-bf16-2025-07-10-07-10-16-076”. Best Practice Is To Take The Name From Endpoint In SageMaker Studio.

2f. Deploy Lambda Function.

3.	Now, Go To AWS Console, Search API Gateway, And Choose REST API.

3a. Click On Import And Upload “generative-ai-api-prod-swagger-apigateway.json”.

3b. Review Resources And Stages.

3c. From The Dropdown In POST Resource, Click On “Integration Request” And Replace The Lambda Function With Your Lambda Function.

3d. If You Already Made Changes In The Code On Desktop, Then Check If It Is Applied.

3e. Deploy API And Create A New Stage Named According To Your Organisation’s Naming Convention.

GenAI Backend Is Ready. Let’s Prepare The Frontend.

4.	On Your Desktop:

4a. Edit “index.html”. Change → var apiGatewayUrl = “{API_GATEWAY_POST_URL}”;

4b. Upload “logo.jpeg” And “index.html” To The S3 Bucket That You Will Choose In CloudFront.
	5.	Go To AWS CloudFront, Create A Distribution, Specify Origin As S3, And Choose The Bucket Where You Uploaded “index.html”.

5a. Go To CloudFront Distribution → General → Edit → Set Default Root Object To “index.html”.

5b. Go To Your CloudFront Distribution → Origins → Check “cloudage-gen-ai…” → Edit → Copy S3 Bucket Policy.

5c. Go To S3 Bucket Containing “index.html” And Edit The S3 Bucket Policy.

5d. Or Paste The S3 Policy From Desktop. Remember To Change The ARN.

5e. Wait Until CloudFront Distribution Deploys To All Edge Locations (It May Take 10 Minutes Depending On The Size Of The Web Application).

5f. Go To CloudFront Distribution → Invalidations → Create Invalidation → Paste “/*”.

5g. Once Deployed, Go To The URL (Distribution Domain Name).

Ask Bigger Questions. Remember This Is A FM Model Trained On AWS Dataset And You Can Deploy Another Model From Hugging Face; However, Your Organisation Will Need To Bear The Cost.

Great Work! Project Completed. All Praise Be To Almighty GOD Alone.
